I am building a tiny and intelligent language model.

Even a 5-year-old can run an AI model on his/her 15$ Raspberry Pi.

---

## Why?

The next generation of builders of the world are 5-year-old now. I want to help them access AI from a scientific & fundamental angle.

Right now the options are limited:
- Use Gemini/GPT/Claude (they don't have a credit card)
- Use a Large Open-source Model (they don't have GPUs)
- Use existing Small Language Models (low quality)

So I'm performing a set of research experiments to build a tiny but intelligent language model that children can install on their computers and do useful things with.

## Funding

I enjoy tinkering with new technical challenges - including AI model training. Along the way, the good people at Inflection Grant & Prime Intellect gave me a small GPU grant to do my experiments.

The more experiments I built, the more grants I received, so I kept going.

## Progress

So far, I have performed a few experiments, and launched one model that generates 3D objects.
