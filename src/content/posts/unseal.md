Journal publishing is predatory, how to fix it?
---

## Inspiration

While publishing my own research paper, I found 3 problems with the journal publishing process:
- Journal publishing costs 2,000 to 10,000 USD
- Readers must pay 40+ USD to read
- Wait time is up to 12 months

Journals make 5,000,000,000 USD per year from this.

Scientific knowledge should be shared openly and freely without pay walls.

## Current progress

I have a few ideas on how to solve this, but I want to hear from the community before fully building this out.

If you have a friend who does research (as a hobby or career), please share with them: https://unseal.world
