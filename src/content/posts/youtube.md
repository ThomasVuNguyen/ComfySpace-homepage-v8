Make complex robot projects simple

---

## Problem

If you are someone starting robotics today, your options are:
- Follow the LED-blinking example projects
- Put yourself in frustration with 1-hour-long complex tutorial projects

Those are both not effective at helping you build great things

## The solution

I built my Youtube channel to make complex & quirky robotics (and sometimes AI) projects simple and fun.
