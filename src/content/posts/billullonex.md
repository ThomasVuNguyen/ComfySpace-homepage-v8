Building AI software & hardware for Enterprise

---

## Story

I met my best friend, Javier on a trip to Miami. He's a guy trying to build cool tech to let folks build their businesses like he did.
He's business-driven with a lot of ideas. I'm technical with the urge to build. We hit it off instantly and have been best friends ever since.

## Company
We are building BillulloNex together. 
BillulloNex is a startup that builds software that companies need to optimize their operations, Saas platforms, on-prem AI deployments.

We're hitting 2 years in 12-2025. It has been a long journey with lots of tears and sacrifices.

It's with pride that I can say this:

- We are profitable and growing organically
- We build great tech
- Our clients are giants in their field
- I can pay myself enough for rent & the occasional travel splurge with my girlfriend
