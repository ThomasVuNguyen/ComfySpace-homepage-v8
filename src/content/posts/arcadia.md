An infinite canvas anyone can draw on and everyone can see.

## Inspiration

I was in the shower, waiting for my water to get hot. That's when I came across Arc Browser's Easle.

I thought to myself: what if we just have a giant canvas for everyone to draw on?

## Building

The 'building' stack is simple:
- Architecture design: Thomas' brain
- Code: Cursor, ChatGPT Codex & Claude Code

All built in 1 week

## Current state

From 2 Reddit posts, we had 400+ people using the product.

Something I have learned managing an open canvas:
- People are generally civilized
- Drawing/Sketching tool is used far more than other tools (text, rectangle, etc.)
- Once a dick/boobie is drawn, the 'population' keeps growing at a dangerous speed

This definitely gave me an appreciation for how countries and communities are managed.
