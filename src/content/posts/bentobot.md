A robot fight tournament you can play from your bed

## Problem

Robot fights are fun as hell. They are like the ultimate sport for robotics and engineering nerds.

However, the current options are expensive and time-consuming with:

- Building your own robots
- Paying for event tickets 
- Flying to the event
- Hotels, food, etc
- Asking your boss for a week off

## The solution

We built 3 robots & 1 application for people to remotely control them.

Robots & application were built in 2 weeks. 
We ran tournaments on my Youtube channel for 4 weeks.

100+ people played. Lots of fun had.

## Current state

The events have ended, check out the streams & the code (yes it's all open-sourced) here:

We got featured on the Raspberry Pi Magazine, which was a great memory for me (:
