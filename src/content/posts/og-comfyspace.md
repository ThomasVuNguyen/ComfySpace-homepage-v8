A universal remote control for hobbyeist robots

---

## Problem

I have been creating robots for many years, and the biggest issue has always been _how to interface with your robot?_

The current options are labor intensive, expensive & not reusable:

- Remote controller
- Bluetooth Modules
- Screens & Displays

## The application

With this in mind, I spent 1.5 years building ComfySpace.

It is a mobile application where you can create buttons and use them to send commands to your Raspberry Pi through SSH.

## Making robotics easier

In the process, I believe the world of robotics has become too difficult for new robotics enthusiasts to get into. So a few tools were built in the process:

- ComfyScript: A scripting language to control robotics components easily
- Jax: An simple starter project, building remote control cars
- Rabbit R1 for 20$
- A Raspberry Pi Emulator

## Friends along the way

Along the way, I met Farooq, a passsionate user of ComfySpace - brilliant 13-year-old kid from Canada.
I also met my good friend Ankitt, who later helped me with designing the user experience.

## Give it a try
